# 162. Find Peak Element

#### A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

#### Given an integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

#### You may imagine that `nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž`.

### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
```
### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2,
or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: piles = [30,11,23,4,20], H = 6
Output: 23
```

### Constraints:
```
1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
nums[i] != nums[i + 1] for all valid i.
```
