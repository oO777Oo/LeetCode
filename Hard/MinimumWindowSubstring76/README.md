# 76. Minimum Window Substring

#### Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the minimum window in `s` which will contain all the characters in `t`.

#### If there is no such window in `s` that covers all characters in `t`, return the empty string `""`.

### Example 1:

```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
```

### Constraints:
```
1 <= s.length, t.length <= 105
s and t consist of English letters.
```
