# Problem 943. Pascal's triangle

### Pascal's triangle is constructed as follows. The first line consists of one number equal to one.

### Each next line contains one more number than the previous one.

### The first and the last of these numbers equals 1, and all the rest are calculated as the sum of the number above it in the previous line and the number to the left of it in the same line.
